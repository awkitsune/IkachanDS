Ikachan (1.5.2) Decompilation (for Nintendo DS)

## Compilation
Should be working with latest devkitPro and libs. Sound is working perfectly with latest devkitPro.

To build it do following:
1. Open MSYS2 in project folder
2. Print `make` in console
3. Wait until software will be compiled, if some errors will appear, try use `make clean`
