Ikachan! Where have you been?/
../
This place?/
I'm not sure. It seems to be+
ruled by a giant fish named+
Ironhead./
Recently, earthquakes have cut+
them off from the rest of the+
sea./
Ironhead has them all paranoid.+
To show your loyalty to Ironhead,+
he makes you carry a pearl around./
Without a pearl, you will be+
attacked by the locals./
I don't have a pearl, so I have to+
hide down here.
../
Hey../
You don't have a pearl either,+
do you?/
Are you looking for one?
<yn0051
Good answer. It's far too+
dangerous to swim near Ironhead./
We're safe down here./
